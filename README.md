# AI-driven-COVID-predictor
This software is developed for predicting COVID-19 severity using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM). It assesses severity by analyzing protein sequences in FASTA format, alongside clade, gender, age, and lineage data. Additionally, it automates the installation of necessary packages.
